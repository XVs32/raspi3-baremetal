Sandbox record
=========================

Use ch09 as a base to play with the code myself

Used an pikachu photo with different format than the provided one

Ignore UTF-8 chapter for now, use ascii instead

Try reading sector in SD, succeed in qemu but failed in real raspi

Make print(int/str) first, so that I can debug SD sector reading(without uart/debugger its kinda difficult for me...)

Added shift pixel function(for the coming print function)

Useful tool

convert jpg to pixel value, use 3 bytes/pixel XXXXXX00 option
